Description: python interactive plots to visualize data of physical model (physics)

The python script is to visualize the energy levels of a two-spin system in gate defined semiconductor quantum dots. 
For the background information about spins physics I recommend the articles PhysRevB.76.035315 and RevModPhys.79.1217.
